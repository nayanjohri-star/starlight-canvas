/**
 * bvh-cskel27.mjs — SAM-3D-Body's Mixamo BVH → the exact motion arrays the
 * npz decoder consumes ({ frames, fps, rotMats, rootPos, posedJoints }).
 *
 * Both skeletons rest in the same T-pose convention (Y-up, spine +Y, left
 * arm +X — verified against CSKEL27_NEUTRAL and the BVH template generator),
 * so a BVH world rotation IS the cskel27 global rotation for the matching
 * joint, and each cskel27 local is recovered as parentGlobalᵀ · global.
 * Joints cskel27 has and the BVH does not (Spine3, the Hand ends) borrow the
 * nearest BVH ancestor's world rotation, which makes their local rotation
 * identity — the same "not authored" rule poseToCskel27 applies.
 *
 * Joint positions are re-grown with FK over the CANONICAL cskel27 skeleton:
 * the take must move CozyClay's body, not drag SAM's per-clip bone lengths
 * into the scene. The root trajectory is scaled by the leg-length ratio and
 * floor-shifted so the clip's lowest foot sample touches Y=0.

// EVERY temporal constant in this file is a DURATION, resolved to frames
// against the clip's own fps at runtime. It used to be a mix, and the frame
// counts were a measured bug: SAM extractions arrive at whatever rate the
// footage ran at — the two fixtures are 30 fps, the user's real capture is
// 60 — and a constant written as N FRAMES covers half the time at 60 fps, so
// it filters half as hard exactly where the per-frame input noise is twice as
// dense (foot wobble measured 3.4 cm on the 60 fps take against 0.6 cm on the
// 30 fps fixtures). Before the conversion, feeding this module a 60 fps
// rendering of the SAME motion produced 1.8x the time-normalized ankle jitter
// and 1.7x the knee jerk of the 30 fps one, and dropped grounding 86.6 → 81.4 %.
// Every duration below is written as <30 fps frames>/30 so that 30 fps
// reproduces exactly the numbers each comment was measured at.

// Stabilization, ported from the proven Blender retarget script the old
// ingest pipeline used (sam3d-retarget-shadow.py):
//  - SPIN: SAM's BVH occasionally winds the root nearly 360° in a few frames
//    when yaw crosses ±180; detected by root angular SPEED (deg/s — as a
//    per-frame threshold the same physical spin reads half as fast at 60 fps
//    and the repair silently stops firing) and bridged with one shortest-path
//    slerp, corrected on EVERY joint so local articulation survives.
//  - TORSO: mild zero-lag three-frame slerp on the trunk only.
//  - LEGS: the same slerp, harder, on both leg chains — see LEG_BLEND.
//  - ARMS: a One-Euro filter instead (#84) — speed-adaptive, so guard-band
//    tremor is cut while punch speed survives; see the ARM_* block.

// is the single largest measured lever on foot tremble: SAM estimates the legs
// frame-independently and they are the joints a fixed camera sees worst
// (self-occlusion behind the torso on every guard-up stance), so their
// per-frame rotation noise is what the ankle — and then the whole grounding
// stack downstream — has to fight. On its own it takes ankle accel RMS
// 2.32 → 1.71 cm and toe 2.53 → 1.83 on boxing-offline (2.29 → 1.65 / 2.50 →
// 1.78 on shadow17); take it back out of the finished stack and the ankle
// returns to 2.35. It costs almost nothing in motion: the 95th percentile
// ankle speed falls 318 → 303 cm/s, so the footwork is smoothed, not killed.

// the guard-band wrist tremor it was meant to fix untouched (1.36 -> 1.36).

// the tremor. One-Euro separates them by SPEED instead: near rest the chain
// is filtered at ARM_MIN_CUTOFF_HZ (SAM's per-frame shoulder/elbow noise is
// what reads as wrist tremble in a guard), while a strike drives the cutoff
// up by ARM_BETA per °/s until the filter passes it essentially untouched.
// Constants are durations/rates (Hz, °/s), so 30 and 60 fps clips filter the
