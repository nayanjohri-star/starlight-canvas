// subject is. The stage has no walls, so every depth cue it carries is one we
// put there on purpose: the grid's converging cells, the floor's distance
// shading and contact shadow, and a horizon the fog does not eat.
//
// Each of those was absent, and each went absent for a defensible reason
// (chrome belongs in the viewport; an unlit deck is cheap; a fogged horizon is
// tidy). These checks pin the reasons back to the surface that needs them, so
// a future cleanup cannot quietly flatten the deliverable again.
