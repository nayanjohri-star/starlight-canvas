/**
 * EXTERNAL blockers for Fix Collisions.
 *
 * fix-collisions.js already knows how to push a limb out of the character's
 * OWN torso: it builds capsule proxies for one rig and treats the trunk as a
 * static blocker. The set has two more kinds of solid thing in it — the other
 * cast members, and the objects the user dropped on the deck — and neither is
 * visible to a solver that only ever looked at one skeleton. This module turns
 * both into the same static-blocker vocabulary the fixer accepts:
 *
 *   { id, kind: "capsule", a: Vector3, b: Vector3, radius }
 *   { id, kind: "box", center: Vector3, halfExtents: Vector3, yaw }   // radians about world Y
 *
 * Everything here is WORLD SPACE and already posed: a blocker describes where
 * something is at the moment it is built, so a whole-clip pass rebuilds the
 * character blockers per frame (the others are animating too) and re-samples
 * any object that walks a travel path.
 *
 * Ids are namespaced so a penetration label reads unambiguously —
 * `leftHand×obj:chair`, `leftHand×char:subject-2:torso` — and so the App can
 * tell an external hit from a self-collision without a second lookup.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no scene graph ownership. The only thing it reads is the
 * rig's live world matrices (through buildCollisionCapsules) and the scene
 * object records, which is what makes it unit-testable headless.

/**
 * One box blocker per scene object, in world space.
 *
 * The box is the object's footprint rectangle extruded to its height, centred
 * half a height above where it stands: `y` is the base above the deck (0 =
 * standing on it), so the centre sits at `y + height / 2`. `yaw` carries the
 * record's `rot` in RADIANS about world Y, which is exactly the convention the
 * renderer places the prop with (props.jsx: `rotation={[rotX·DEG, rot·DEG,
 * rotZ·DEG]}`).
 *
 * Skipped, and why:
 *   - `plane` and anything else of zero height: a card lying flat on the deck
 *     is the floor, and the floor already has its own clearance rule
 *     (PUSH_FLOOR_CLEARANCE). A zero-thickness blocker would also make every
 *     escape normal degenerate.
 *   - no resolvable footprint: nothing to build a rectangle from.
 *   - an ATTACHED prop (`attach` non-null): while attached, x/y/z/rot are the
 *     prop's LOCAL transform in a bone's frame, not world — placing that box in
 *     world space would put a solid obstacle at a fictional position. Resolving
 *     it needs the live scene graph (attachFrameMatrix), which this pure module
 *     deliberately does not have; the App can pass such objects in itself once
 *     it wants carried props to block.
 *   - anything named in `skipIds` (the object being dragged, say).
 *
 * Pitch and roll (`rotX`/`rotZ`) are a documented approximation: the box stays
 * upright, exactly as `objectFootprintBounds` treats a tilted prop. Yaw is
 * exact.

 * blocking off for everybody else. Finger capsules are left out — see
 * isFingerCapsule.
 *
 * `characterIds` is the CAST as it stands, and passing it is what keeps a
 * ghost out of the set: the rig map is keyed by character id and an undo that
 * removes a subject puts the cast list back without necessarily evicting the
