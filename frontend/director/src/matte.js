/**
 * Background removal: the step between "a photo" and "a cutout".
 *
 * A card IS its transparency. A JPEG of a sofa imported as-is stands up as a
 * rectangle of somebody's living room, which blocks nothing and reads as a
 * mistake in the frame. So the picture has to lose its background before it
 * can be a set piece.
 *
 * This is the cheap, offline half of that job (issue #17 P2): grow a region
 * from the edges of the frame and drop what it reaches. It cannot cut a
 * subject out of a busy street — that is the model-backed half, P3, which
 * belongs behind the same runner boundary as ARDY — but it is exact on the
 * pictures previs actually uses: a product shot, a prop on a sweep, anything
 * photographed against a wall.
 *
 * Two rules make it hold up on real photographs:
 *
 *   - Growth is LOCAL. A pixel joins the background if it is close to the
 *     pixel it grew from, not merely close to the corner it started at. A wall
 *     that shades from top to bottom is one region; a global threshold either
 *     stops halfway up it or eats the subject.
 *   - Growth is also BOUNDED by the seed colours, so a local chain of small
 *     steps cannot walk across a soft edge and out the other side into the
 *     subject.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: pixels in, pixels out, no DOM. `cutOutBackground`
 * at the bottom is the browser glue, and every browser API it needs is
 * injected — the same seam `importImageFile` uses, for the same reason.
