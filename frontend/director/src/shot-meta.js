/**
 * What a framing capture SAYS about the shot it came from.
 *
 * A PNG on its own is just pixels: an agent handing it to a video model still
 * has to know the lens, the delivery aspect, who is in frame and which model
 * the shot is aimed at. This module answers that in one pure object, so both
 * capture paths (the live `capture_framing_png` command and the embed-mode
 * message handler) describe a pull the same way.
 *
 * Pure data: no DOM, no React, no three.js — it runs in node tests and in the
 * browser unchanged. Everything is read defensively because callers pass live
 * editor state, where a shot can be missing entirely (no shots authored yet).
