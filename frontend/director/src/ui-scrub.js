 * gesture feel right are arithmetic, not React: "has the hand travelled far
 * enough that this press is a drag and not a click?" and "how much value does
 * a pixel buy?". They live here so a Node test can prove them without a DOM.
 *
 * Sensitivity is a RATE over a fixed travel, the same rule the timeline's
 * curve editors follow (src/ardy/timeline.jsx DRAG_TRAVEL_PX): dragging the
 * hand across `SCRUB_TRAVEL_PX` sweeps one meaningful span of the field. The
 * old `pixels * step` mapping tied the feel to the field's precision, so a
 * step 0.05 field needed 100 px to move 5 units while a step 1 field bolted.
