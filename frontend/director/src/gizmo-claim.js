// Which GIZMO_LAYER surfaces own the press under them (#81).
//
// GIZMO_LAYER carries two very different kinds of things: grabbable handles
// whose own listeners run AFTER ObjectGizmo's window-capture selection handler
// (the twin gizmo's pick proxies, the key-light sun, path and crane dots), and
// pure furniture that owns no press at all (the selection cage, the drawn
// arrows and rings, rail lines, floating labels). ObjectGizmo must yield a
// press aimed at the former — claiming it would deselect the character and
// kill the drag their handler was about to start — but treating EVERY layer
// hit as a claim let the SELECTED object's own cage veto a press aimed at a
// different object's body, so Cube -> Sphere selection never happened.
//
// The split is explicit marking: a surface that handles its own press carries
// one of these userData keys, everything else on the layer is furniture and
// never blocks selection. This module has no three.js import on purpose — the
// predicate is plain ancestor-walking, directly testable under Node.
