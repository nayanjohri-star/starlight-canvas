/**
 * The transform gizmo for the selected scene object — the thing every 3D tool
 * has and this one did not: axis arrows to slide an object along X/Y/Z, rings
 * to spin it and boxes to scale it, straight in the shot view, with the plan
 * board's 5 cm / 5° detents so both views agree.
 *
 * Three deliberate choices:
 *
 * - Picking is owned here, not delegated to R3F. The shot camera renders into
 *   a letterboxed 16:9 sub-rect of the canvas, so R3F's canvas-wide pointer
 *   NDC is vertically off by the size of the bars and small cones would never
 *   be hit. The rect the camera actually drew into is what the ray is built
 *   from.
 * - The listener sits on `window` in the CAPTURE phase. The fly-camera
 *   controls listen on the canvas element itself and were registered first;
 *   only a capture-phase listener further up the tree can stop a press on the
 *   gizmo — or on an object — from also swinging the camera.
 * - Unity's division of labour: a plain left press SELECTS and nothing else,
 *   transforms only ever come from a handle, and a press on empty space clears
 *   the selection. Dragging the body used to move it, which made selecting an
 *   object — just to read its numbers — nudge the set. The plane handles below
 *   are the honest replacement for that.
 *   (docs/unity-reference.md §3.2, §6, §9.3, §9.6)
 *
 * The axis rings drive the object's X/Y/Z Euler channels directly. With the
 * yaw-only rotations blocking actually uses that is exact; with all three
 * channels live it is the usual world-axis-to-Euler approximation, same as
 * any DCC's global-space rotate. The outer screen-space ring is different:
 * a roll about the view axis legitimately touches all three channels at
 * once, so its delta is composed onto the current orientation in quaternion
 * space and decomposed back into the same channels (screenRotatePatch).
