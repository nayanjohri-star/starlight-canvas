# CozyClay Studio Design Contract

## 0. Research Log

- Existing product surface: preserved the current dark Unity-like editor,
  compact timeline controls, violet camera identity, and bilingual labels.
- Interaction reference: the destructive action uses the existing immediate
  editor-button mechanism; no modal or animation is introduced because rail
  geometry is reversible by drawing it again and the state change is local.
- No new dependency, font, layout primitive, or motion token is required.

## 1. Direction

CozyClay is a dense production tool, not a dashboard. Controls stay compact,
technical, and close to the timeline state they change.

## 2. Color and surface tokens

The v2 shell uses brightness steps to separate regions. Regions do not have
borders; the surface value does the work.

- **Surfaces:** gap/background `#070708`; bars `#121214`; panels `#151517`;
  raised/hover `#1e1e21`; active control `#26262a`; fields `#0f0f11`;
  deep field `#0c0c0d`; in-panel divider `#1d1d20` (list rows only);
  viewport overlay pill `rgba(12,12,13,.78)`.
- **Text:** primary `#e4e4e7`, secondary `#9b9ba1`, tertiary `#636369`;
  list rows `#c9c9ce`, disabled/ticks `#4f4f55`, selected title `#fff`.
- **Accents:** selection and active controls use amber `#e8a33d`, with the
  selected-row tint `rgba(232,163,61,.14)` and text on amber `#1a1204`.
  Camera marks, rails, dots, buttons and primary actions use violet
  `#7258a0` or its light mark value `#a78bfa`.
- **Functional colours:** destructive `#e5484d`; axes X `#e5484d`, Y
  `#4fbf7a`, Z `#4c8dff`; status ok `#4fbf7a`; dirty dot `#e8a33d`.
- **Track chips:** folder `#8a7a55`, mesh `#7e8b99`, cast `#5fb584`, camera
  `#a78bfa`, light `#d9b84a`, motion `#6f93d6`.
- **Sequencer fills:** camera `#3d3354` / `#302a40`; body `#23402f`; selected
  body `#2e5a3f`; prompt `#233149` with text `#b9c9ea`.

## 3. Type, spacing, and region sizes

- IBM Plex Sans is used at 400/500/600 weights. UI text is 12 px, secondary
  text is 11–11.5 px, and titles are 15 px at 600 weight.
- JetBrains Mono is used at 400/500 for keys, numbers and frames, at 10–12 px.
  Fonts are self-hosted woff2 assets; the shell does not load a CDN font.
- Controls are 28 px or 24 px high. Control corners are 4 px; pills and cards
  use 6 px. The spacing scale is 8 / 12 / 16 px.
- The 2a shell is 1920×1080: top bar 44 px, right column 340 px, bottom dock
  330 px, status bar 24 px. Panel headers are 36 px, Outliner rows 24 px,
  Sequencer rows 38 px with a 190 px track tree, and Content is 620 px wide.
- **Top bar (`#121214`):** a 20 px project swatch, project name and dirty dot,
  File/Edit/Window/Help menus, MCP status, and the violet Generate Motion
  action.
- **Viewport:** a `+ Add` pill and Perspective / Clay Lit / Show pill at top
  left; the single mode+tool pill at top centre; fly speed at top right; axis
  gizmo at bottom left; and a 300 px camera preview with a 26 px header and
  letterbox bars at bottom right.
- **Right column:** Outliner is 420 px tall with a 36 px header, 28 px search,
  and 24 px tree rows. Details is selection-driven with a 15/600 name, an 11 px
  type line, a 64 px transform label plus X/Y/Z fields, and 24 px category rows.
- **Bottom dock:** Content is 620 px wide with Content / Log tabs, breadcrumb,
  160 px search, a 140 px folder list and a six-column asset grid. The selected
  asset has a 1.5 px amber ring. Sequencer fills the remaining width.
- **Status bar:** 24 px high, JetBrains Mono 10.5 px; status text is on the
  left and fps plus save state are on the right.

## 4. Motion and Interaction


- Camera toolbar actions respond immediately.
- Crane editing exposes explicit Add point and Remove point actions beside the
  selected point height and count. Add point fills the largest un-authored
  interval and selects the new mark; Remove point is enabled only for a
  selected interior mark. The scene double-click/Delete gestures remain
  accelerators, never the only discoverable route.
- When a Shot uses Rail + Crane, its lower key strip represents crane progress:
  clicking the strip authors a crane point at that rail position, and the
  matching purple/amber marker stays synchronized with the scene handle.
- Binary camera actions state themselves in text (`Follow On` / `Follow Off`)
  and expose `aria-pressed`; Follow sits directly beside `Draw rail` and uses
  the existing violet Camera Block active state.
- Active drawing state continues to use the existing filled violet state.
- Destructive rail deletion uses a red hover/focus cue and an explicit text
  label; no icon-only or right-click-only deletion.
- Keyboard focus must remain visible.
- The camera tutorial's existing card owns the first-shot handoff: one primary
  Export action and one Continue editing dismissal. It uses existing panel,
  border, text and accent tokens, 8 px gaps and the 11 px control scale. Only
  buttons take pointer input. The existing Export popover owns delivery and
  keyboard focus; no second menu or modal is introduced.
- The hosted tutorial reuses its completion area for the edited-project
  download and local Studio instructions. Continue editing keeps the iframe
  alive. Pending/error/download-requested states use text, not animation.
- Full-Body editing is direct and frame-addressed: `Cut` splits at the
  playhead, while each resulting green segment owns a compact speed selector.
  Speed changes redraw the segment width immediately; there is no decorative
  transition because the new duration is the information.
- Full-Body speed runs from `0.1×` to `4.0×` in `0.1×` steps. The current
  segment is identified by the playhead and receives the brighter green
  selected state. Its slider and numeric stepper stay in the fixed timeline
  header instead of inside the segment, so a one-frame segment remains
  editable. Outer trim handles continue to own only the complete take's
  in/out points.

## 5. v2 shell gap fills and reusable primitives

The following gap fills are part of the v2 contract. They describe the
missing behaviour in the same grammar as the owner's 2a, 2b and 2c screens.

### G1 — mode and tool toolbar

One 32 px pill sits at the viewport top centre in this order: mode keys `1 2 3
4`, divider, tool keys, divider, context values. The active mode shows its
amber mono digit and its name (Stage / Pose / Camera / Motion; in Korean,
배치 / 포즈 / 카메라 / 모션); inactive modes show only a 28×28 digit. W/E/R
keys are 28×28, with the active tool filled amber `#e8a33d` and text
`#1a1204`; inactive tools use `#9b9ba1`. Every key has a title with its full
name and shortcut.

- Stage: W Move, E Rotate, R Scale; values `10cm` and `15°` (snap toggles on
  click and Ctrl inverts it).
- Pose: W Pose fix, E Path fix, R Pin; value `0.25s` (click opens a 24 px
  influence slider).
- Camera: W Move, E Rotate; values `24mm` and `2.39` (each opens a small list).
- Motion: W Blocks and E Refine; no value group.

Keys 1–4 switch modes and W/E/R select tools only when focus is outside a text
field.

### G2 — mode to state mapping

Stage keeps `workflowMode "scene"` for the bus and saved views. Pose uses the
new `workflowMode "pose"`; entering it runs `toggleIkMode` and leaving it runs
`leaveIkMode`. Without a character with IK chains, key 2 is disabled and its
title explains why. Camera and Motion use `"camera"` and `"motion"`. Motion E
uses `enterRefineMode` / `lineEditMode`, and `view.setMode` accepts `"pose"`.

### G3 — Pose Details

For a selected character or rig group, Details lists Pose (Foot lock, Body
contact, influence range), the selected tool section, then Auto-fix. Path fix
contains Trails, Trail falloff and a violet Regenerate from trail edit action;
Pin contains the range-pin controls as 24 px rows. Auto-fix has Fit to platforms
[Run]/[Remove], Body collisions [Frame]/[Clip], and Physics cleanup [Run] with a
collapsed Advanced row.

### G4 — auto-fix preview and apply

Fit to platforms and Physics cleanup show `Preview · <fix name>` in amber, one
summary row and at most five result rows, followed by 28 px Cancel (`#1e1e21`)
and violet Apply. Enter applies and Esc cancels; the status bar says
`Preview — Enter apply · Esc cancel`. Affected character ranges get a 2 px
amber Sequencer underline. Body collisions remains direct and undoable.

### G5 — Sequencer

The 36 px header has the title, 26×24 transport, amber mono frame readout
`0092`, `/ 0240 · 24fps`, and mode-specific 24 px buttons: Stage/Camera Cut,
Draw rail, + Track; Motion Cut, + Block; Pose Cut. Tracks group each character
(Prompt, Body, Pins, IK keys) and camera (Camera Cuts, Rail, Crane). The playhead
is amber, pin ranges are amber at 35% alpha, and existing Cut, speed, trim and
crane editing continue to work.

### G6 — Motion takes

Motion Details for a selected character has 24 px Takes rows such as
`v1 · 0:18 · seed 42`; the current row uses the amber tint and calls
`loadTakeVersion`. Generate Motion runs today's `runArdy`; its caret menu has
Start over, Take it again and Add block at frame N. Keep the current take is in
collapsed Motion › Advanced. The old Scene/Refine take bar is removed.

### G7 — export and save

The File menu contains New, Open…, Save `⌘S`, Save As…, then Export ▸ with
Keyframe pack (zip) `⌘E` first, Video (mp4), Depth + normal, Storyboard (PNG),
and OTIO cut list only when a shot exists. Existing ids stay on the moved
controls: `topbar-save`, `topbar-export`, `export-keyframe-pack`,
`export-video`, `export-otio`, `export-menu-trigger`. Save state remains
`data-testid="project-save-status"` in the 24 px status bar (`Autosaved 2 min
ago` / `Unsaved changes`); export progress, retry and cancel use
`export-status` there and in Log.

### G8 — menus and Show

Edit contains Undo, Redo and Preferences… (2c); Window contains Agent, Content
and Log; Help contains Tutorial, Keyboard shortcuts and About. Show is the
viewport's Reference grid, Auto Color, Body part colours and Trails menu. Clay
Lit is the shading list; Perspective is the camera/view list. Language,
Analytics and Motion setup move to Preferences (General › Appearance and
Motion › ARDY Connection). UI copy contains no Kimodo, ProjFlow or 2D Root.

### G9 — Agent pane

Window › Agent changes the right column's lower header to Details | Agent in
the same style as Content | Log. Closing it restores Details.

### G10 — adding things

There are exactly two visible add routes. Viewport `+ Add` opens the object
catalogue plus Character and Camera. Content › Basic Shapes lists catalogue
primitives; drag to the viewport or double-click to place. The Outliner
right-click Create ▸ accelerator remains. The hierarchy `AddObjectMenu` and
Props inspector `AddObjectMenu` are removed.

### G11 — responsive shell

The bottom dock is `clamp(220px, 30vh, 330px)` with a drag handle. Content can
collapse to its 36 px header so Sequencer takes the width. At ≤1440 px the right
column is 300 px. At 1280×800 the viewport remains at least 480 px tall and
900 px wide.

### G12 — start and Preferences

Screen 2b replaces the project browser/startup chooser with today's samples;
without samples it shows only Blank Stage. Screen 2c is a modal Preferences
dialog built from Settings: motion setup, language, analytics, auto colour,
snapping and a read-only hotkeys list.

### Reusable primitives

- `.tl-camera-tool`: compact camera-toolbar action.
- `.tl-camera-tool.active`: active/engaged action.
- `.tl-camera-tool.danger`: destructive camera-toolbar action.
- `.tl-camera-metric`: read-only measured camera value.
- `.tl-motion-clip`: one cut Full-Body segment.
- `.tl-motion-clip.selected`: segment under the playhead.
- `.tl-motion-speed-editor`: fixed header slider and numeric stepper for the
  Full-Body segment under the playhead.
- `.tl-crane-editor`: card-local time/height graph; the graph inserts points,
  points have enlarged targets, and vertical drags edit height without moving
  the Shot block.
- `.motion-readiness`: compact text-labelled generation status beside the
  generation controls. It distinguishes checking, ready, not configured,
  unavailable and unsupported routes without gating authoring. It inherits
  `--fg`, `--muted`, `--cyan`, `--panel`, `--line2`, `--radius`, the 11 px
  inspector scale and 4/8 px spacing; state is never colour-only.
- `.motion-setup`: an explicitly opened region in Settings, not a modal or
  another topbar control. Documentation opens separately and Retry only probes
  health. It preserves the scene and prompt blocks, scrolls within the viewport,
  wraps commands, and keeps controls reachable at 390 px. Status uses polite
  announcements, visible keyboard focus and immediate state changes.
- `.camera-tutorial-handoff`: the contextual action row inside the existing
  tutorial; it wraps at narrow widths and has visible keyboard focus.
